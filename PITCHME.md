@title[So what is JavaScript?]
"JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement **complex things on web pages** — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the **third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies**." From [Mozilla Developer Network Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
