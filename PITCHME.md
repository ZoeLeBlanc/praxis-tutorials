Note: Welcome to JavaScript! IMHO the most magical thing on the internet. Gets a bit of a bad wrap but powers almost everything on the web, including this slideshow. So what is Javascript?

@title[So what is JavaScript?]
"JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement **complex things on web pages** — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, or interactive maps, or animated 2D/3D graphics, or scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the **third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies**." From [Mozilla Developer Network Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript) 
Note: Any guess on the other two?

Note: the other two being html & CSS which you guys have already started learning . So now that we have a baking analogy, Today we're gonna bake your very own three layer standard web technology cake and go over some of the more common syntax you'll come across with JavaScript. First though

#### About JavaScript...
- Initially introduced in 1995 for Netscape Navigator Browser 
- Has nothing to do with Java (just named the same for marketing) |
- JavaScript standards are set by ECMA International, which is why developers often refer to new updates to JavaScript by their ECMAStandard Version (eg. ES5, ES6, and ES7) |
- BEST RESOURCE for JavaScript is the Mozilla Dev Network Docs and W3Schools |
- If you don't know it, google it & ask for help!!!! |
Note: Now we're ready set bake!

``` 
mkdir 'name of your directory'
touch index.html
touch main.js
touch main.css
```

@[1](First thing set up a directory on your computer)
@[2-4](Then create an index.html, main.css, and main.js file)
Note: Can anyone remember how to set up an initial index.html file?
---
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
@[1](First DOCTYPE)
@[2,10](Then html tags)
@[3-6](Then head tags with the title and link to our stylesheet)
@[7-9](Then body tags and this is where we connect our JavaScript file with a script tag)
Note: Now we can start creating our first javascript file
---
add hello world to javascript file
show them alert
console log
---
can also manipulate the DOM
document get Element by Id
insert html
---
So how do we do this!
first thing is declaring a variable
a few different ways but most common one you'll see is var equal sign followed by a value
lots of different values
---
First strings
length
replace
indexOf charAt
toLowerCase
toUpperCase
---
Numbers
decimals, floats, integers
operators +,-,/,%, * 
---
Arrays
accessing values
adding (push) removing (pop)
filtering
---
Objects
accessing properties
---
Booleans
True or False
set a variable to either of these or you can test them with methods
---
Conditional Statements
if else
logical operators
for loops
---
Functions
function arguments
